Alternatively, our [Tutorials section](../tutorials/index.md) contains step-by-step tutorials to help outline what Kubeapps is capable of while helping you achieve specific aims, such as installing Kubeapps or using an OIDC provider.

If you have a specific goal, but are already familiar with Kubeapps, take a look at our [How-to guides](../howto/index.md). These have more in-depth detail and can be applied to a broader set of features.

Finally, for a better understanding of Kubeapps architecture, our [Background section](../background/index.md) enables you to expand your knowledge.
