# Kubeapps Helm Repository (Stable)

This page documents the stable Helm repository for Kubeapps. It is published via GitHub Pages and includes an `index.yaml` generated by CI, pointing to released chart packages.

- Stable index: [index.yaml](https://sap.github.io/kubeapps/helm/index.yaml)
- Repo URL for Helm: `https://sap.github.io/kubeapps/helm`

## Add the repository

```bash
helm repo add sap-kubeapps https://sap.github.io/kubeapps/helm
helm repo update
helm search repo sap-kubeapps
```

## Install the chart

```bash
helm install my-kubeapps sap-kubeapps/kubeapps --namespace kubeapps --create-namespace
```

## Contents

The stable repository contains:

- **index.yaml**: Helm repository index for stable releases (tags matching `vX.Y.Z`).
- **Chart packages (.tgz)**: stable Kubeapps chart archives produced from release tags.

> Note: The index and packages are updated automatically by a GitHub Actions workflow whenever a new stable release is published. You can also manually trigger a regeneration from the Actions tab.

## Troubleshooting

- If `helm repo add` fails, ensure you can access [index.yaml](/helm/index.yaml) in your browser.
- Run `helm repo update` to refresh local cache.
- Check the repository URL matches your organization/repo GitHub Pages path.
